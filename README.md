# Simple Web Dashboard

This is an Arduino library for the ESP8266 and ESP32. It is an easy way to
remotely view internal state.

## Usage

See the example.

## Why this library?

Use this if you just want to display some values. This library is relatively
small and lightweight. The bulk of this library is in the ESPAsyncWebServer.

The page served by this library uses no external resources. It uses vanilla
javascript to dynamically update the page.
